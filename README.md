# BayesianPersonalizedRanking-matlab
## An implementation of Bayesian Personalized Ranking in Matlab.
### It is a rough but simple implementation, to use this code, just simply download all the four files to the same position and started to run **BPR.mlx**.

* BPR.mlx: The main function of all the files, it will use the BPR method to optimize the AUC value.
* ratings.csv: The data used by this code(movielens-small).
* Vtrain.m: The training step of the model.
* AUC.m: Use this function to calculate the AUC value.
